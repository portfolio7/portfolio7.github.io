In this project a ball moves up and down when we click on up/down button and when we click on left right button it moves left to right from that position.

A simple moving ball program developed in Visual Basic which contains 2 buttons up/down and left/right. If we click on left/right button then ball begins to move on left side and strikes the wall and moves backward to the right side. If we click on up/down button then ball moves in an up and down position where we stop the ball and if we click on stop button ball will be stopped.
